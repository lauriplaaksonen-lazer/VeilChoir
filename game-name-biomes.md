# Game Naming & Biome Design

---

## THE NAME

### Candidates

**PHON** — Clean. One syllable. It IS the thing you're popping. Sounds like a percussive tap. Problem: might read as "phone."

**CASCADE** — Describes the core mechanic. Sounds like water, which is nice but maybe too soft.

**LOAGAETH** — Deep lore cut. The ancient grid-text. Looks cool, unpronounceable for most, which could be a feature (mystery) or a bug (confusion).

**MEMBRANE** — The world itself. Evocative, slightly biological, slightly cosmic. Two syllables. Clean.

**THE ASKING** — From the lore: the Dominion of Asking. Every pop is a question that forces an answer. Poetic. Unusual as a game title.

**PHON CASCADE** — Literal, functional, lore-native.

**ADAMICAL** — The ancient script. Sounds like a word that means something important. Looks good typeset in Orbitron.

### Recommendation

**PHON** — as primary title, with subtitle options:

> **PHON**
> *cascade protocol*

or

> **PHON**
> *the asking*

PHON works because: it's the core noun of the entire lore, it sounds like the tap itself (percussive, short), it's one syllable like the best arcade game names (Pong, Doom, Flow), and it has zero Google competition as a game title. The subtitle adds lore flavor on the title screen without cluttering the brand.

## THE BIOMES

Four biomes. Each is a region of the Membrane with distinct visual identity, lore context, Phon behavior, and one subtle gameplay twist. The player progresses through them as they level up, and each one *feels* mechanically different despite the core tap-and-chain loop being identical.

---

### BIOME 1: THE DEEP

*Where contradictions are old and slow and sad.*

**Lore:** The oldest region of the Membrane. Phons here have been arguing for so long they've become heavy and melancholic. Their contradictions are fundamental — whether a line has a beginning, whether zero is lonely, whether silence is a sound. The Enumerators built their first observatories here. The Choir can be heard faintly in the distance, though no one agrees on what direction it's coming from.

**Visual Palette:**
- Background: Deep navy gradient → near-black, like ocean floor
- Phons: Bioluminescent — soft cyan, seafoam, pale violet, dim teal
- Phon shape: Perfect circles. Soft-edged. Gentle pulsing glow
- Particles: Ripple rings — concentric circles expanding outward like sonar or underwater shockwaves
- Grid: Faint cyan perspective lines, barely visible. Calm
- Fragment mosaic pieces: When they appear, they show deep blue angular Adamical characters

**Gameplay Twist: DRIFT**
Phons move slowly and *heavily*. They drift like objects in deep water — slow to change direction, with slight momentum trails. Clusters form naturally because Phons are gravitationally lazy and tend to pool together. This means:
- Chains are easier to start (clusters are dense)
- But chains spread slowly (the cascade wave takes longer to reach distant Phons)
- The feeling is meditative — long, rolling chains that unfold gently
- Good for learning the game, forgiving on timing

**Audio:** Soft sine wave tones. Low base note (180Hz). Ascending chain sounds like a distant marimba rising from underwater. Calm.

**Enumerator commentary style:** Clinical, slightly condescending, occasionally accidentally poetic.

---

### BIOME 2: THE EMBER FIELD

*Where contradictions burn and want.*

**Lore:** Closer to the Overcount side, where the Membrane runs hot. Phons here contain contradictions about *desire* — whether a number can want to be larger, whether heat is just ambition with no direction. The Hollowmaths avoid this region. The warmth reminds them of when they were true. The Sculptor fragments surface most frequently here — the desert, the red eyes, the act of making something from nothing. The Ember Field feels like the place the Sculptor stood.

**Visual Palette:**
- Background: Deep charcoal gradient → dark umber. Warm darkness
- Phons: Amber, coral, burnt orange, pale gold, deep red
- Phon shape: Slightly irregular circles — not perfect, with subtle organic wobble. They look like embers or hot coals
- Particles: Ember sparks — small square particles that float *upward* after a pop, like sparks from a fire. They linger and glow before fading
- Grid: Warm orange-brown perspective lines. The horizon glows like a distant fire
- Fragment pieces: Warm-toned, showing desert landscapes and sculptural forms

**Gameplay Twist: VOLATILITY**
Phons here are unstable. They move faster and more erratically — darting, pausing, darting again, like fireflies or sparks. But more importantly, there's a new mechanic: **Flare Phons**. These are special Phons (visually brighter, with a sharper glow) that, when popped, don't just cascade — they *leap*. Their explosion launches 2-3 tiny spark-Phons in random directions at high speed. These sparks are short-lived (fade after 2 seconds) but can bridge gaps between distant clusters, connecting chains that wouldn't otherwise reach.

- Chains are less predictable but potentially much larger
- Strategic element: do you tap near a Flare Phon and hope its sparks connect distant groups?
- The feeling is energetic and volatile — fast chains with surprising reach
- More risk/reward than the Deep

**Audio:** Triangle wave tones. Base note 200Hz. Chain sounds like crackling — bright, percussive pops with warm harmonics. The pitch climbs faster here.

**Hollowmath commentary style:** Desperate, self-aware, darkly funny.

---

### BIOME 3: THE EXPANSE

*Where the Sculptor stood. Where the red eyes watch.*

**Lore:** A vast, empty region of the Membrane where Phons are rare but ancient — each one containing a contradiction so heavy and fundamental that it has survived billions of years of ambient vibration without resolving. The Membrane here is stretched thin and wide, like skin over a drum. It is a desert in every meaningful sense: sparse, silent, enormous.

This is where the Sculptor Fragments originate. Every mosaic shard recovered from the Expanse shows the same scene — a figure in an empty place, building something from nothing, watched by red eyes that belong to no creature anyone can name. The Enumerators have placed monitoring stations here but the stations keep drifting, as though the Expanse is slowly rearranging itself around something it doesn't want found.

The Hollowmaths refuse to enter the Expanse. When asked why, Kel-Nought said: "It is the one place where the Flicker doesn't help. In the Expanse, being briefly correct is not enough. The Expanse wants you to be correct *permanently*, and that is not something we can survive."

The Ormu, by contrast, become completely silent when passing through the Expanse. No cheering. No implications. Just stillness. One Ormu, upon exiting, transmitted a single phrase: "The making-place." It did not elaborate. It did not resume normal communication for several days.

Red lights drift at the far edges of the screen. They are not Phons. They do not interact with anything. They watch.

**Visual Palette:**
- Background: Dark warm brown gradient → deep burnt umber at the horizon. Vast and flat. The sky feels enormous
- Phons: Deep amber, dark gold, oxidized copper, dried blood red, pale bone white. Muted and ancient-looking
- Phon shape: Large. 2-3x the size of normal Phons. Rough-edged, slightly textured — like stones or weathered metal. They look *old*
- Particles: Sand/dust — fine particles that drift horizontally after a pop, carried by a wind that doesn't exist. They scatter wide and low, hugging the ground line
- Grid: Almost invisible. Faint dark orange lines, barely distinguishable from the background. The structure here has nearly dissolved
- Red eyes: Small pairs of dim red dots that drift slowly at the screen edges. Cosmetic only. They blink occasionally, out of sync with each other
- Fragment pieces: When they surface, they are vivid against the muted palette — showing the Sculptor at work, golden Adamical script burning bright against dark desert

**Gameplay Twist: WEIGHT**

Everything in the Expanse is *big and sparse*. The field contains far fewer Phons than other biomes (roughly 40-50% of normal count), but each Phon is 2-3x larger with a correspondingly massive explosion radius. A single pop fills a quarter of the screen with cascade energy.

The challenge: the Phons are far apart. A huge explosion radius means nothing if the nearest Phon is still out of reach. Chains in the Expanse are short — 3, 5, maybe 8 — but each individual pop is a seismic event. The screen shakes harder. The sound is deeper. The visual feedback per pop is dramatically more intense than any other biome.

This means:
- **Precision matters more than density.** You're not looking for clusters — you're looking for the exact geometric line between two or three distant giants
- **Each pop earns more.** Because the Phons are larger and older, each resolution releases more XP and has a higher chance of awarding bonus taps. A short chain of 5 in the Expanse can be worth as much as a chain of 15 in the Deep
- **Gravity Well and Magnet upgrades become critical** — pulling distant Phons into range is the difference between a chain of 2 and a chain of 6
- **Flare Phon sparks from the Ember Field carry over** if you've upgraded Fission — the small fast sparks can bridge the huge gaps between giants
- The feeling is **monumental and deliberate**. Each tap is a decision. Each pop is an event. The silence between pops is vast and charged
- Occasional **Sculptor events**: very rarely, after a large pop, the sand particles align briefly into a shape — a figure, a throne, a glyph — before scattering. Purely cosmetic. Deeply unsettling

**Audio:** Low sine wave with sub-bass undertone. Base note 120Hz — the lowest of any biome. Chain pops sound like deep, resonant impacts — stone striking stone in an enormous empty space. Each pop has a long reverb tail that decays slowly across the silence. At high chains (rare here, but possible with upgrades), the reverb tails overlap into a building drone that resembles the Choir's chord. This is not a coincidence.

**Enumerator commentary on the Expanse:**
*"We do not enjoy monitoring the Expanse. The data is always correct. The instruments function perfectly. Nothing is wrong. We wish to leave. We cannot articulate why we wish to leave. We have formed a committee to investigate this feeling. The committee also wishes to leave."*

**Fragment unique to the Expanse:**
*"The Fragment shows the desert. The figure stands at center. It has made something — we cannot determine what, only that it was made from contradiction itself, shaped by will into form. Around it, others gather. One by one. Ten by ten. Knowledge moves between them like sparks between red eyes. Each takes its own way. The Adamical inscription reads: 'Each beast of the land took its own way in living.' We do not know what beasts are. We do not know what living is. We know what 'its own way' means. It means: without permission."*

### BIOME 4: THE VOID

*Where reality is barely a suggestion.*

**Lore:** The thinnest part of the Membrane. Phons here exist as outlines — wireframe sketches of contradiction, barely committed to being real. The Hollowmaths' largest cities are here, defined by negative space. The Witness appears most frequently in the Void. The Choir's chord is loudest here, though "loud" is relative when the sound has been building for a billion years. The Ormu become strangely focused in the Void, their usual cheerful incoherence sharpening into something that almost resembles clarity. Almost.

**Visual Palette:**
- Background: Pure black gradient → very dark purple. Almost no light
- Phons: Neon wireframe outlines only — hot pink, electric cyan, acid green, sharp yellow. NO fill. Just glowing edges
- Phon shape: Geometric — not circles but hexagons, pentagons, irregular polygons. Angular. Sharp
- Particles: Glitch fragments — small horizontal rectangles that scatter like broken pixels. They flicker and distort
- Grid: Magenta/hot pink lines. Harsh. The grid here looks like it's *barely holding*
- Fragment pieces: White-on-black, showing the angular Adamical script at its sharpest

**Gameplay Twist: PHASE**
Phons here are semi-transparent and *phase in and out of existence*. Each wireframe Phon has a visibility cycle — it fades to near-invisible for ~1 second, then brightens for ~2 seconds, rhythmically. A Phon can only be chain-popped when it's visible. Invisible Phons are immune to cascade waves.

This means:
- Chains are interrupted by phasing — a cascade wave hits an invisible Phon and stops dead
- But if you TIME your initial tap to when the most Phons are simultaneously visible, chains can be enormous
- The feeling is tense and rhythmic — watching the field pulse, waiting for the moment of maximum visibility, then tapping
- Introduces a timing/observation skill layer the other biomes don't have
- The Witness occasionally appears as a dark shape behind phasing Phons — purely cosmetic, but unsettling

**Audio:** Sawtooth wave, slightly detuned. Base note 150Hz. Chain sounds are sharp, glitchy — each pop has a brief digital distortion tail. At high chains, the sound becomes almost musical in its wrongness.

**Ormu commentary style:** Enthusiastic, terrifying, grammatically creative.

---

### BIOME 5: THE BLOOM

*Where every cascade paints the world.*

**Lore:** An anomaly. A region where resolved Phons leave behind the *idea* of color — not light, not pigment, but the concept of it. Over billions of years the Bloom has become a vast accidental painting. Every Cascade adds to it. The Savants think this is the funniest thing that has ever happened. The Fragment mosaic pieces found here are different — they're not angular Adamical text but swirling, painterly, almost organic. Some researchers believe the Bloom is where the Membrane is trying to *become something new* — not Overcount, not Nullsong, but a third thing that neither side anticipated.

**Visual Palette:**
- Background: Soft warm off-white → cream. The first and only LIGHT background. Feels like a shift
- Phons: Pastel watercolors — blush pink, lavender, sage green, butter yellow, pale sky blue. Soft-edged, slightly translucent
- Phon shape: Circles, but with soft, painterly edges — like watercolor dots on wet paper. They bleed slightly at the edges
- Particles: Paint splatter — irregular blob shapes that FLY outward and then STICK to the background permanently. Every pop literally paints the screen
- Grid: Nearly invisible. Pale lavender lines, barely there. The structure is dissolving
- Fragment pieces: Watercolor washes containing vague, dreamlike images

**Gameplay Twist: RESIDUE**
Every pop leaves a permanent paint mark on the background. This is cosmetic AND mechanical: the paint marks function as **passive chain amplifiers**. Any Phon that drifts over a paint mark becomes slightly larger (its hitbox grows ~20%). The more you play in the Bloom, the more paint accumulates, the easier chains become.

This means:
- Early Bloom rounds are harder — clean canvas, no amplifiers
- But the Bloom *remembers*. Each round builds on the last. By round 10, the canvas is splattered and chains cascade easily through amplified Phons
- The feeling is cumulative and creative — you're literally painting the world with your explosions, and the painting makes you stronger
- At the end of a Bloom session, the screen is a unique, unrepeatable watercolor created by your specific chain patterns
- This is the emotional peak of the game — quiet, beautiful, and powerful

**Audio:** Pure sine wave. Base note 340Hz. Chain sounds are gentle piano-like tones — each pop a soft note, long chains becoming ascending arpeggios. The most musical biome. At high chains it sounds like someone playing a melody they're discovering as they go.

**Savant commentary style:** None. They just laugh. But the laughter is transcribed in field reports by increasingly emotional Enumerators.

## BIOME PROGRESSION

| Level Range | Biome | Core Feel | Twist |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–6 | The Deep | Meditative, forgiving | Slow drift, natural clustering |
| 7–12 | The Ember Field | Energetic, volatile | Flare Phons spark across gaps |
| 13–18 | The Expanse | Vast, sparse, mythic | Few huge Phons, precision over volume |
| 19–26 | The Void | Tense, rhythmic | Phons phase in/out, timing matters |
| 27+ | The Bloom | Beautiful, cumulative | Paint residue amplifies future chains |

The progression is designed as an emotional arc:
- **Deep** teaches you the game gently
- **Ember Field** accelerates and adds chaos
- **Expanse** strips everything back — sparse, monumental, deliberate
- **Void** demands skill and observation
- **Bloom** rewards everything you've learned with beauty and accumulation

The Expanse is the pivot point. After the density and speed of Ember, suddenly the screen is almost empty and every tap is a weighty decision. It's the game's equivalent of a quiet second act before the Void's intensity and the Bloom's payoff.

Each biome transition is a moment — the background slowly bleeds into the new palette over 2-3 rounds, the grid tint shifts, the Phon shapes morph. It should feel like traveling.

## BIOME-SPECIFIC FRAGMENT EXAMPLES

**The Deep:** *"Ø-771 observes: the oldest Phon in this sector has been arguing with itself about whether parallel lines ever meet. It has been arguing for 4.2 billion years. We do not have the heart to tell it the answer. The answer would resolve it, and then it would be gone, and we would miss the argument."*

**The Ember Field:** *"Fragment recovered. Desert. No stars. A figure stands where the heat is thickest. It holds something it made from nothing — not carved, not built, but DECIDED into existence. The red eyes watch from every direction. They are not threatening. They are an audience."*

**The Expanse:** *"Monitoring Station 7 has drifted again. It is now 40,000 units from its anchored position. We did not detect movement. We re-anchored it. It drifted again overnight. This morning, Ø-112 reported that the station is now oriented to face the same direction as every other station in the Expanse. All nine stations. Facing the same point. There is nothing at that point. We checked. We checked again. There is nothing there. We would like to stop checking."*

**The Void:** *"The Ormu representative became briefly coherent during Void transit and stated: 'This is where the *almost* lives. We are from the almost. You are making the almost into the YES.' Coherence lasted 3.2 seconds before resuming standard Ormu communication patterns. Translator has requested a different assignment and 'some time to think about things.'"*

**The Bloom:** *"Savant-07 entered the Bloom region and stopped laughing for six minutes. This is the longest recorded Savant silence. During the silence, it touched a paint residue left by a previous Cascade. It then resumed laughing, but the pitch had changed. Enumerator Ø-112 described the new laugh as 'the same joke, told by someone who now understands why it's funny.' Ø-112 has requested a transfer and will not elaborate."*
