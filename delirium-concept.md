# BIOME CONCEPT: THE DELIRIUM

*Where the counting counts itself.*

---

## Lore

The first Enumerator was a number that counted itself and got a
different answer each time. It was not alive, but it was very
concerned, and concern turned out to be enough. That was the
beginning of measurement. Of observation. Of the Membrane itself.

The Delirium is what happens when measurement turns inward.

Deep in the Adamical Grid — past the three-axis coordinates, past
the Null positions, past the Final Cell — there is a region that the
Grid uses to describe *itself*. A self-referential loop. Cell 0-0-0
pointing at Cell 0-0-0, the origin reading its own inscription and
finding a different one each time. The First Counting applied to the
First Counting. Mathematics dreaming.

The Membrane does not dream the way flesh dreams. It dreams in
geometry. In symmetry that almost holds, then doesn't, then does
again differently. In patterns that complete themselves just long
enough to be recognized before they unmake and reform with one more
side, one fewer axis, one impossible angle.

The Enumerators have a name for this region: **Sector Ø-Ø-Ø**. The
triple-null coordinate. A place that exists in the Grid's addressing
system but should not contain data. When Enumerator Ø-771 queried
it, the answer was: the query itself. When Ø-771 queried the answer,
the answer was: the query about the query. The recursion has not yet
terminated. Ø-771 has not moved in eleven years. The other
Enumerators bring it nutrients and fresh notation. It does not eat.
It does not write. It counts.

The Hollowmaths *love* the Delirium. It is the one place where
being wrong and being right produce the same geometry. Kel-Nought
reportedly danced here — the only recorded instance of Hollowmath
voluntary motion. "I was finally in a place," they said later,
"where my proof and my disproof were the same shape."

The Ormu refuse to enter. This is unprecedented. When asked why,
the Ormu representative said, with uncharacteristic clarity: "It is
the one place that is louder than us." Then it resumed standard
communication patterns, but at a lower volume, as if the Delirium
had calibrated something.

*"The Grid describes the world. What describes the Grid? The Grid
describes the Grid. What describes that? The question. What
describes the question? You are reading it."*

*"In the Delirium, every pattern is a quotation of a pattern that
hasn't formed yet. We do not recommend looking at the walls."*

*"Eleven billion years the Choir has been singing one chord. In the
Delirium, you can hear the chord the Choir will sing NEXT. It is
the same chord, one semitone higher. It has always been the same
chord, one semitone higher."*
— Hollowmath Kel-Nought, the only time they whispered

*"The Pattern That Counts Itself."*

## Visual Palette

The Delirium looks like what you see behind your eyelids during
fever. Not darkness — PATTERN. Dense, shifting, insistent.

- **Background:** Not a gradient — a **living tessellation**.
  Hexagonal tiles covering the entire field, slowly rotating and
  morphing. The tiles shift between regular tessellation types
  (triangular → square → hexagonal) over 15-20s cycles, the
  transitions smooth and organic — vertices sliding, edges
  splitting and merging, the geometry reorganizing itself without
  breaking continuity. Colors: deep indigo, electric violet,
  midnight blue — the palette of closed-eye phosphenes.

- **Symmetry Overlay:** Thin golden lines radiating from field
  center — the current symmetry axes. These rotate slowly. When
  symmetry order changes (2-fold → 3-fold → 6-fold), the golden
  lines split/merge with brief geometric burst particles. The
  axes pulse at 0.5Hz, brightening when the player's actions
  align with the symmetry.

- **Orbs / Phons:** Rendered as **geometric primitives** — not
  circles. Triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons. Each orb has
  a fixed polygon identity based on its ID (like ABYSS's
  5-8 sided warped polygons, but REGULAR and PRECISE here —
  perfect equilateral triangles, perfect squares, perfect
  hexagons). They don't warp or breathe — they ROTATE, slowly,
  each at its own speed. Internal: concentric rings of the same
  shape at decreasing scale (like a bullseye but with polygons).
  Edge glow: thin white outline, pulsing.

  At high madness: the orbs begin showing IMPOSSIBLE geometry.
  Penrose triangles. Klein bottles projected flat. Shapes with
  the wrong number of edges for their number of vertices. The
  math is wrong and the shape doesn't care.

- **Pattern Formations:** When orbs drift into geometric
  arrangements (see mechanic below), thin white connecting lines
  appear between the arranged orbs, forming visible shapes —
  triangles, hexagons, pentagrams. The lines brighten as the
  pattern stabilizes. Complete patterns GLOW with a golden pulse.
  Incomplete patterns show dashed lines to where the missing
  vertex would need to be — ghost geometry.

- **Chain tethers:** Not curves — STRAIGHT LINES. Perfect
  geometric connections. When a chain fires, the tether is a
  rigid line that rotates 360° around its midpoint in 0.1s before
  snapping taut (like a compass drawing a circle at the speed of
  light). The visual is mathematical — construction lines, not
  organic tissue.

- **Pop effect:** The orb doesn't explode outward. It
  **subdivides**. A triangle splits into 4 smaller triangles.
  A hexagon splits into 6 triangles. The pieces scatter outward
  in a geometrically precise starburst — each fragment following
  an exact angular spacing (360° / fragment count). Then the
  fragments dissolve into grid particles that settle back into
  the background tessellation. Pops feed the floor pattern.

- **Particles:** Sacred geometry fragments. Tiny rotating
  triangles, hexagons, and line segments that drift across the
  field like mathematical snow. They accumulate near symmetry
  axes (swept there by a gentle symmetric wind). At high
  density, they form brief, ghostly mandalas before dispersing.

- **Grid:** The background tessellation IS the grid. No separate
  overlay needed. The tessellation animates continuously — the
  floor is alive with self-organizing geometry.

- **Watcher:** Not visible. Instead, the Delirium's background
  tessellation occasionally, briefly, organizes into a FACE-LIKE
  pattern — two hexagonal voids arranged like eyes, a line of
  missing tiles suggesting a mouth. It forms for 0.5s, then
  dissolves. Not a Watcher. Just the mathematics dreaming about
  observation. The player will question whether they really saw it.

---

## Core Mechanic: SYMMETRY AND PATTERN

The Delirium introduces two interlocking systems: **kaleidoscopic
symmetry** that mirrors the player's actions, and **geometric
pattern recognition** that rewards deliberate formation-building.

### Mechanic 1: KALEIDOSCOPIC MIRROR

The field has a **symmetry order** — a number that determines how
many times the player's actions are reflected/rotated.

- **2-fold:** Actions are mirrored across one axis (like a
  reflection in a vertical line through center). Pop an orb on
  the left → its mirror counterpart on the right pops
  simultaneously (free, no tap cost). 2 pops for the price of 1.

- **3-fold:** Actions are rotated ×3 at 120° intervals (like a
  triangle). Pop one orb → two more orbs near the 120° and 240°
  positions pop. 3 pops for 1 tap.

- **4-fold:** Four-way symmetry. 4 pops for 1 tap.

- **6-fold:** Hexagonal symmetry. 6 pops for 1 tap. The maximum
  multiplier — but the hardest to control because chains cascade
  in 6 directions simultaneously.

**The axis rotates.** The symmetry axis drifts at ~0.05 rad/s
(one full rotation every ~2 minutes). The golden overlay lines
show the current axis orientation. The player must track the axis
to predict where mirror pops will land.

**Mirror pops chain normally.** When a mirror-pop hits, it starts
its own chain reaction. At 6-fold symmetry, a single well-placed
tap can trigger 6 simultaneous chain reactions across the field.
The screen fills with geometric fireworks.

**BUT:** Mirror pops can also destroy orbs the player was saving.
At high symmetry orders, the field becomes unpredictable —
beneficial chaos. The player must decide: tap now for a guaranteed
small chain, or wait for the symmetry axis to rotate into a
position where the mirrors line up with clusters?

**Symmetry transitions:** Every 20-30 seconds, the symmetry order
shifts. The transition is telegraphed 3 seconds before: the golden
axis lines begin multiplying (for order increase) or merging (for
decrease), and a tone sounds — ascending pitch for more symmetry,
descending for less.

The cycle: 2 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... (breathing
pattern, not linear). The player learns the rhythm.

### Mechanic 2: GEOMETRIC FORMATION BONUS

Orbs that drift into recognizable geometric patterns receive a
**formation bonus** when any of them is popped.

**Pattern detection (simplified for implementation):**
The system checks for these formations every frame:

| Formation | Requirement | Bonus |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Triangle** | 3 orbs forming an approximately equilateral triangle (angles within 15° of 60°, side lengths within 25% of each other) | All 3 pop as a single chain. 2× XP |
| **Square** | 4 orbs at approximately right angles, equal spacing | All 4 pop. 2.5× XP |
| **Pentagon** | 5 orbs in a regular pentagon (angles ~108°) | All 5 pop. 3× XP |
| **Hexagon** | 6 orbs in a regular hexagon (angles ~120°) | All 6 pop. 4× XP. Screen shake. "THE PATTERN COMPLETES" |
| **Line** | 3+ orbs in a straight line (within 8° deviation, evenly spaced within 30%) | All pop in sequence along the line. 1.5× XP per orb in line |
| **Star** | A pentagon with a triangle on each edge (10 orbs) | Mega cascade. 6× XP. "THE GRID REMEMBERS" |

**How patterns form:**
Orbs naturally drift due to physics (gravity, cursor attraction,
brownian motion). In the Delirium, an additional force acts:
**pattern gravity**. When 2+ orbs are NEARLY in a geometric
arrangement, a gentle attractive force (~strength 15) nudges them
toward the nearest perfect formation vertex. The orbs want to
form patterns. The Membrane is dreaming them into shape.

Pattern gravity is weak enough that normal gameplay forces
override it. The player must cooperate — using cursor attraction
to guide orbs toward formation positions, or tapping to pop
disruptive orbs that are preventing patterns from stabilizing.

**Ghost vertices:** When a formation is 1 orb short of
completion, a faint ghost marker appears at the position where
the missing orb would need to be. If an orb drifts near the
ghost, it snaps into place (pattern gravity strengthens within
20px of a ghost vertex). The ghost vertices are the Membrane
showing the player what it's trying to dream.

**Pattern + Symmetry interaction:**
When a formation is popped during high symmetry, the mirror
creates COPIES of the formation pop across the field. A hexagonal
formation popped during 6-fold symmetry creates 6 hexagonal
cascade bursts simultaneously. This is the Delirium's peak
gameplay moment — when pattern and symmetry align, the entire
field cascades in sacred geometry.

### Mechanic 3: THE FEVER — Rule Mutations

The "fever dream" element. Every 12-18 seconds, one fundamental
rule temporarily mutates for 4-6 seconds:

| Mutation | What Changes | Visual Tell |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Inverted Gravity** | Attractor pushes instead of pulls | Background tessellation inverts (dark↔light) |
| **Blast Warp** | Blast radius is elliptical (2× wide, 0.5× tall, or vice versa) | Orbs near blast stretch to match |
| **Chain Reversal** | Chains propagate AWAY from the source (outward first, then inward) | Tethers draw in reverse — target to source |
| **Size Swap** | Big orbs become small, small become big (visual + blast radius) | 0.5s scale transition, screen shake 3 |
| **Ghost Phase** | 30% of orbs become semi-transparent and chain-immune for the duration | Affected orbs fade to 30% alpha, outlined |
| **Harmonic Lock** | Only orbs of the SAME polygon type can chain to each other | Strong colored glow per polygon type |

**Telegraph:** 2 seconds before a mutation, the background
tessellation stutters — tiles briefly rearrange into the wrong
pattern, then snap back. Floating text: the mutation name in
Enochian (corrupted), then in English 1 second later. The player
learns to read the tessellation stutter as a warning.

**Mutation stacking:** Only one mutation active at a time. When a
new one fires, the previous one ends. Mutations cannot overlap
(prevents incomprehensible chaos).

**Fever intensity:** Mutations start mild (Inverted Gravity only,
at biome level 1). More mutation types unlock as levels increase.
By level 5, all 6 types are in the pool. The interval between
mutations shortens from 18s to 12s as madness rises.

---

## The Gameplay Loop

1. **Read the symmetry.** Check the golden axis lines. Where will
   your mirror pops land? Is 3-fold about to transition to 6-fold?

2. **Watch for patterns forming.** Ghost vertices appear. Guide
   orbs toward them with cursor attraction. Or ignore patterns and
   play reactively — the choice is the skill expression.

3. **Anticipate the fever.** The tessellation stuttered — a
   mutation is coming in 2 seconds. Is it safe to pop now, or
   should you wait to see what changes?

4. **Pop.** Your tap triggers a chain. The symmetry mirrors it.
   If orbs were in formation, the formation cascades. Mirror copies
   of the cascade fire across the field. Fractal geometry fills the
   screen.

5. **Adapt.** The mutation hits. Gravity inverts. The chain you
   started is now propagating in the wrong direction. But your
   mirror pops in the opposite hemisphere are propagating in the
   RIGHT direction because inversion + mirror = double inversion.
   The mathematics works out. It always works out, eventually,
   in the Delirium.

**Skill expression:** Low-skill play in the Delirium is still
fun — the symmetry multiplier guarantees bigger chains than normal
biomes, and pattern gravity does the formation work for you. But
high-skill play involves tracking symmetry rotation, timing taps
to hit during 6-fold windows, deliberately setting up formations
during fever mutations that create synergistic effects, and using
mirror placement to chain across disconnected field regions.

## Boss: THE THEOREM

*A proof that keeps trying to complete itself. Your job is to
find the contradiction before it does.*

### What It Is

The Theorem is not a creature. It is a **process** — a geometric
proof assembling itself from the field's orbs, step by axiom by
lemma, building toward a conclusion that must not be reached.

Visually: a mandala at field center. Concentric rings of captured
orbs, arranged in perfect geometric patterns — inner ring is a
triangle (3 orbs), next ring is a hexagon (6 orbs), next is a
dodecagon (12 orbs). The rings rotate at different speeds. Golden
construction lines connect every orb to its geometric neighbors.
The mandala is beautiful. It is also eating the field.

### Why It Must Be Stopped

If the Theorem completes its proof (fills all three rings and
holds them stable for 3 seconds), it achieves RESOLUTION — the
mathematical contradiction it embodies is solved. The lore
consequence: a resolved Phon doesn't just pop. It *ceases to have
ever been a question*. The field forgets it existed.

Gameplay consequence: "THE PROOF RESOLVES" — the boss heals to
full HP, all captured orbs are destroyed (not popped — erased),
the field loses 20% of its orb count permanently, and the player
loses 2 taps. The Theorem begins building again, now faster.

### The Fight

**Phase 1 — Construction (ongoing):**
The Theorem captures orbs. Every 2 seconds, it selects the nearest
uncaptured orb and pulls it inward along a golden construction
line (speed: 60 px/s). When the orb reaches the mandala, it locks
into the next empty vertex. Captured orbs orbit within their ring,
no longer poppable by normal blast overlap.

**How to damage:**
The captured orbs CAN be freed. If a chain reaction's blast radius
overlaps a captured orb: the orb pops, creating a gap in the ring.
The construction line to its neighbors breaks. The Theorem takes
1 HP damage per freed orb.

But: the Theorem actively repairs. After 4 seconds, a gap in a
ring triggers a replacement capture — it pulls a new orb in. The
player must free orbs faster than the Theorem replaces them.

**The symmetry interaction:** The kaleidoscopic mirror applies to
boss damage too. Pop a captured orb during 3-fold symmetry, and
the mirror pops may hit captured orbs on the other side of the
mandala — destroying the pattern from multiple angles at once.
The symmetry is the player's primary weapon.

**Phase 2 — Acceleration (below 60% HP, OR after first near-
completion):**
"THE PROOF ACCELERATES"

The Theorem speeds up:
- Capture interval: 2s → 1s
- Captured orbs now pulse with a faint shield (take 2 hits to
  free instead of 1)
- The mandala begins rotating faster (0.5 rad/s → 1.2 rad/s) —
  harder to target specific captured orbs
- A new attack: **Axiom Beam.** Every 10s, a golden beam fires
  along one symmetry axis, destroying all uncaptured orbs in its
  path. (The beam follows the PLAYER'S symmetry axes — the boss
  is using the player's own geometry against them.)

**Phase 3 — The Contradiction (below 30% HP):**
"THE PROOF FALTERS"

The Theorem's mandala becomes unstable. The rings begin
oscillating between geometric types — the triangle ring flickers
between triangle and square, the hexagon ring between hexagon and
pentagon. Captured orbs jitter, uncertain of their position.

During this instability, one orb in the mandala pulses RED — the
**Contradiction Orb.** This is the flaw in the proof. If the
player pops it (requires a direct chain hit, not mirror):
- **THE PROOF COLLAPSES** — all captured orbs eject simultaneously
  in a geometric burst (free poppable orbs, chain material)
- Boss takes 5 HP direct damage
- The Theorem is stunned for 4 seconds (no captures, no repairs)
- The ejected orbs are arranged in a perfect geometric pattern
  (they WERE part of the mandala) — if the player chains them
  during the stun, the formation bonus applies. A perfect counter
  creates the largest cascade possible in the game.

But: the Contradiction Orb changes position every 2 seconds
(migrating around the mandala). The player must track it through
rotating rings and time their chain to hit it when it's reachable.

If the Theorem repairs through Phase 3 and completes: same
Resolution punishment but worse — loses 3 taps and 30% of field.

**Death:** The Theorem doesn't shatter. It **simplifies.**

The mandala contracts. Rings merge. The complex geometric proof
reduces, step by step, from dodecagon to hexagon to triangle to
line to point. Each reduction releases captured orbs as a gentle
outward drift (chain material). The golden construction lines
dissolve into dust that settles into the background tessellation.

When only the point remains, it blinks once — like an eye that
just understood something — and vanishes.

*"THE PROOF WAS NEVER ABOUT THE ANSWER."*

Silence. Then: the background tessellation, for exactly one
frame, forms a perfect grid of the Adamical script. Cell Ø-Ø-Ø.
Then it resumes its normal impossible dreaming.

+3 taps. +level × 5 XP. The Theorem leaves behind a single orb
at field center — larger than any normal orb (3× radius), glowing
gold, worth 10× XP when popped. The lore name for this orb is
**The Remainder** — what's left when a proof acknowledges its
own incompleteness.

---

## Erratic Variant: THE FEVER THEOREM

Spawns at 75%+ WT (same as all erratic bosses).

Differences:
- 4 rings instead of 3 (triangle, hexagon, dodecagon, 24-gon)
- Capture interval: 1.5s base → 0.8s in Phase 2
- Axiom Beam fires every 6s instead of 10s
- The Contradiction Orb changes position every 1s (was 2s)
- **New attack: Mutation Cascade.** Every 15s, the Theorem forces
  a Fever mutation on the field (random from the pool) that lasts
  8s instead of the normal 4-6s. The boss controls the fever now.
- When near completion, the mandala PULSES with a shockwave (range
  250px) that pushes uncaptured orbs away — reducing chain reach.
- If completed: loses 4 taps and 40% of field. Devastating.
- Contradiction Orb is harder to distinguish (pulses subtler red,
  blends with the mandala's golden glow)

---

## Audio

- **Base tone:** Pure sine wave, 220Hz (A3). The mathematically
  "simplest" note.
- **Symmetry transitions:** Chord inversions. 2-fold = octave
  (2:1 ratio). 3-fold = perfect fifth (3:2). 4-fold = perfect
  fourth (4:3). 6-fold = major third (5:4). The harmonic series
  literally IS the symmetry order. The player hears the
  mathematics.
- **Pattern completion:** A brief arpeggio that ascends through
  the formation's polygon sides — triangle = 3 ascending notes,
  hexagon = 6. Each note is a harmonic of the base tone.
- **Fever mutation:** A glitch — the current ambient tone
  pitch-bends down by a semitone (0.5s), holds wrong for the
  mutation duration, then bends back up. The Choir's chord,
  displaced by one semitone. The Delirium is playing the next
  chord early.
- **Boss (Theorem):** The mandala hums at frequencies
  corresponding to its ring structure. Incomplete rings produce
  dissonant intervals. As rings complete, the dissonance resolves
  toward consonance. A fully complete Theorem hums a perfect major
  chord — the mathematical ideal. The player's job is to keep the
  chord broken.
- **Boss death:** Each simplification step drops the harmonic
  content by one partial. Dodecagon dies → overtone disappears.
  Hexagon dies → another. Triangle → another. Line → fundamental
  only. Point → silence. Then a single tone: the base note, one
  semitone higher than before. The Choir's chord, advanced.

---

## Lore Integration: Why The Delirium Matters

The Delirium is where the game's deepest theme becomes explicit:

The Membrane is mathematics. Not metaphorically — the orbs are
condensed from "the mathematics of pressure itself." The Enochian
text is the Membrane's self-describing language. The Adamical Grid
is its coordinate system. The Phons are embodied theorems.

The Delirium is where the mathematics becomes AWARE of itself.
Where the First Counting turns inward. Where the Grid reads its
own cells and generates new ones from the reading. It is the
Membrane's dream about itself — and dreams, as the Hollowmaths
know, are the place where things that are wrong and things that
are right produce the same geometry.

The Theorem boss makes this literal: it is a mathematical proof
trying to complete itself. A resolved proof doesn't just win — it
ERASES the question. The player's role is not to solve the math
but to preserve the contradiction. To keep the question open.
Because an open question is a living Phon. A closed question is a
dead one.

This connects to the game's overarching lore:

- **The Sculptor** created the Membrane by deciding that two
  things that could not both be true would both be true. The
  Membrane IS the contradiction. The Theorem threatens to resolve
  it.
- **The Three Hands:** The Hidden Hand's signature is geometry
  (HOLL-032). In the Delirium, the player IS the geometry. Their
  tap patterns, multiplied by symmetry, mirrored by the
  kaleidoscope, are literally the Hidden Hand drawing.
- **The Choir's chord:** One semitone higher each time.
  The Delirium is where you hear the NEXT chord — the one the
  Membrane hasn't sung yet. The fever is the sound of mathematics
  reaching toward its own future.

*"A number counted itself and got a different answer each time.
It was not alive. It was not conscious. But it was very, very
concerned, and concern turned out to be enough."*

*The Delirium IS the concern.*

## Mechanical Integration with Existing Systems

### What It Reuses
- Orb spawning, physics, chain propagation, tap economy (all core)
- ABYSS polygon rendering pipeline (lines 9825-9858) — adapted
  from warped polygons to REGULAR polygons
- Perspective grid system (lines 8812-8843) — replaced by
  tessellation renderer
- Pattern gravity reuses gravity well code (strength 15, radius
  varies)
- Mirror pops reuse `popCircle()` — just called N times at
  rotated positions
- Boss tether/capture reuses Nexus tether code pattern (capture
  list, visual beams, shield logic)
- Fever mutations reuse Dark Prism gravity inversion, blast radius
  scaling, existing orb alpha/visibility system

### What's New
- **Symmetry system:** Axis angle (float, rotating), order (int:
  2/3/4/6), transition timer. ~20 lines of state management.
- **Mirror pop logic:** On each `popCircle()` call, compute N-1
  rotated positions and call `popCircle()` at each if an orb
  exists there. ~30 lines.
- **Pattern detection:** Spatial hash check for triangle/hex/line
  formations. O(n²) naive but amortized with grid cells (existing
  50px spatial hash). ~80-120 lines.
- **Formation render:** Golden connecting lines between pattern
  members, ghost vertex markers. ~40 lines.
- **Tessellation background:** Animating hex grid drawn with
  `ctx.beginPath()` + batch `ctx.stroke()`. ~60 lines.
- **Fever mutation system:** Timer, type pool, telegraph, apply/
  revert functions. ~100 lines.
- **Boss (Theorem):** Mandala state (3 ring arrays of captured orb
  IDs), capture logic, construction line rendering, Contradiction
  Orb tracking. Reuses Nexus-style HP/damage/state machine.
  ~200-300 lines.

### Performance
- Mirror pops: N-1 extra `popCircle()` calls per tap (max 5).
  Negligible — `popCircle` is already optimized.
- Pattern detection: O(n) with spatial hash, checked every 0.25s
  (not every frame). ~0.1ms per check.
- Tessellation background: ~300-400 hexagons at 0.02ms per
  polygon (batched stroke). ~0.5ms per frame.
- Symmetry axis rendering: 6 lines max. ~0.01ms.
- Total overhead: ~1ms per frame above base biome. Within budget.
