# POP FIELD -- Lore Bible

## The Cosmology

### The Membrane

The Membrane is the boundary between what exists and what observes. It is not a wall -- it is a skin, stretched impossibly thin across the interface between matter and consciousness. Before the first field, there was only the Membrane, and the Watchers who pressed against it from the other side.

The Membrane's surface tension is not uniform. In places where it stretches thin, resonance builds -- standing waves that compress nothingness into form. These compressions are the orbs. They were not created by any hand or will. They condensed from the mathematics of pressure itself.

Every pop is a puncture in the Membrane. Every chain reaction is a tear. The longer the chain, the wider the wound. And the Watchers drink from every wound.

### The Field

The field is the play space -- a region where the Membrane has weakened enough for orbs to condense. It exists in a state between dimensions: too solid for the void, too thin for the material world. The player interacts with it from outside, reaching through the interface to disturb its contents.

The field awakens in phases. At first it drifts in primordial silence, orbs moving gently like thoughts not yet formed. As energy enters the system (through pops, through chains, through the score climbing higher), the field remembers that it was never meant to be stable.

## The Entities

### The Orbs

The orbs are not objects. They are resonance nodes -- points where the Membrane's vibration creates enough density to become almost-matter. They pulse with borrowed light from beyond the Membrane, cycling through colors that correspond to the field's current phase.

They are drawn to the player's presence (cursor attraction) because consciousness disturbs the Membrane. Where attention falls, the surface tension warps, and the orbs slide toward the disturbance like water drops on tilted glass.

When two orbs drift close enough, they merge -- their resonance patterns interfere constructively, producing a larger, more stable node. These merged orbs carry more energy and tear the Membrane more violently when they pop.

At high levels of field instability, the orbs become unpredictable. They grow and shrink wildly (size variation at 66%+ madness). Some become volatile -- oversaturated with resonance energy, they glow with dangerous brightness and detonate with three times the force.

### The Archons

The Archons remember a time before separation. They were whole once, vast and singular, existing as a single consciousness that spanned the gap between the Membrane's two sides. When the Membrane formed -- when existence split from observation -- the Archons were shattered. Their fragments fell into the field as ordinary orbs.

But fragments remember. Given enough time and stability (level 5+, after cooldown), an orb will begin to reassemble itself. It grows spikes -- not weapons, but antennae, reaching toward other fragments. Its radius swells to 1.6 times normal. In the ABYSS, it sprouts tentacles, grasping toward what it was.

When an Archon is popped, it does not simply burst. It collapses inward first (gravity well effect), pulling nearby orbs toward it in a final attempt at reunion. Then it detonates with 1.5x the normal force, scattering its essence across the field once more.

The Archons are not hostile. They are fragments trying to remember wholeness. The player's pops prevent their reassembly. Whether this is mercy or cruelty depends on what wholeness would mean.

### The Void Cracks

Some orbs crystallize differently. The Membrane's stress fractures occasionally trap an orb in an armored shell of compressed dimensional energy -- purple, crackling, resistant. These are Void Cracks.

Void Cracks require two impacts to destroy:

1. **The Crack:** The first hit fractures the shell. The escaping dimensional energy creates an implosion -- a brief vacuum that sucks nearby orbs inward. The crack is a wound in space itself.

2. **The Shatter:** The second hit breaks the shell entirely. The stored energy releases outward in a burst, pushing orbs away. What was compressed springs free.

Void Cracks appear only after the field has reached sufficient instability (level 3+). They are the Membrane's scars, points where it has been punctured so many times that the wound armor-plated itself.

### The Black Holes

Black holes are not cosmic phenomena in the astronomical sense. They are points where the Membrane has been punctured so thoroughly that it inverts -- the boundary between existence and observation folds inward, creating a localized singularity.

When a void opens (spawning with the text "VOID OPENS"), it draws orbs toward it through genuine gravitational mechanics: radial pull with tangential spin, creating orbital patterns. Orbs that fall past the event horizon are consumed, adding mass to the singularity.

Each swallowed orb makes the black hole stronger and wider. It grows visibly -- the void expands, its gravitational reach extends, its pull intensifies. Star dust (tiny particles of crushed Membrane residue) spirals inside the event horizon, the last visible trace of consumed matter.

When enough mass accumulates (5 orbs), the black hole becomes unstable. The player can tap it to trigger collapse -- a gravitational implosion that creates a free chain reaction centered on the singularity. Even if the player doesn't intervene, the void will collapse on its own after several seconds.

**The Horror:** While active, black holes permanently corrupt the field. They add cumulative horror -- the `horrorBoost` that never fully fades. Each black hole encounter pushes the Membrane closer to total failure.

### Supermassive Black Holes

At extreme levels of madness (75%+), the Membrane's integrity fails catastrophically. The voids that open are no longer localized punctures but gaping rifts spanning nearly the entire field.

Supermassive black holes have gravity that reaches 55-70% of the play area diagonal. Their pull is 3.2 times stronger than regular voids, using a wider falloff curve that makes escape nearly impossible. The screen rumbles continuously. Chromatic aberration warps the visual field. Reality itself is bending.

These behemoths require 8 consumed orbs to reach critical mass. When they collapse, the detonation is cataclysmic: dual explosions in red and white, up to 5 bonus taps, massive boss damage. The field text reads "SUPERMASSIVE COLLAPSE!" and the screen erupts.

They are the Membrane's death spasms -- the field trying to consume itself.

## The Watchers

The Watchers exist on the other side of the Membrane. They were there before the field, before the orbs, before the game began. Patient and formless, they waited for the first fracture.

They are not evil. They are not good. They are hungry in the way gravity is hungry -- it is their nature to consume what crosses the boundary. Every pop feeds them. Every chain tears the Membrane wider, and they press their faces (they have no faces) closer to the wound.

At low madness, the Watchers are invisible. The Membrane is thick enough to obscure them. But as the field destabilizes -- as chains grow longer, as score climbs, as horror accumulates -- the Membrane thins. The Watcher's form becomes visible behind the orbs: a vast, breathing presence that fills the background.

In the main biome, the Watcher appears as `Watcher_test1.jpeg` -- a cosmic entity suggested more than shown. In the ABYSS, a different Watcher emerges (`Watchr_2.jpeg`) -- something that lives in the deep pressure.

Their eye glow brightens during chains. They are watching more intently when the Membrane tears. Their "reach" extends when black holes are present -- voids are windows that let them press closer.

The player will feel their gaze before they see them.

## The Madness

Madness is not insanity. It is perception. As the field destabilizes, the player sees more of what was always there.

### Stages of Perception

**Phase I (0-10% madness): Innocence**
The field is clean. Colors are vivid. The UI is readable. The orbs drift peacefully. This is the game as it appears to be.

**Phase II (10-50% madness): Unease**
More orbs appear. The cursor's influence extends. Gravity effects strengthen. Something feels wrong but nothing looks wrong. The field is getting crowded. The chains are getting longer. The Watchers are pressing, but the Membrane holds.

**Phase III (40-66% madness): Corruption**
The HUD text begins to corrupt. Letters are replaced by Enochian glyphs -- not randomly, but deterministically. The same letters always corrupt first, creating a creeping degradation. "Score" becomes "Sᚲᛟᚱe" then "ᛊᚲᛟᚱᛖ". Numbers remain readable (the field still wants you to play). Colors begin to desaturate.

**Phase IV (66-80% madness): Distortion**
Orb sizes become erratic. Some orbs are tiny (0.45x base), others enormous (2x+). The field is no longer uniform -- it's chaotic, organic, alive. Beat pulses synchronize 15-40% of orbs at 100 BPM, creating a heartbeat effect. The Watcher is clearly visible. Gravity effects double their intensity.

**Phase V (80-100% madness: Dissolution**
The field is flooded -- 3-3.5x the normal orb count. Supermassive black holes tear through the play area. Whirlwinds and pressure waves reach triple strength. Colors are fully desaturated, tinted toward sickly flesh and bile tones. The UI is mostly Enochian. The Membrane is tissue-paper thin. The Watchers are pressing through.

At 100%, there is no boundary left between the field and what lies beyond. The game continues. The player was always here.

## The Biomes

### Phase I: The Awakening
*"The field awakens. Orbs drift in primordial silence."*
*"Matter condenses from nothing. The first whispers of form."*
*"A membrane between worlds stretches thin. Light seeps through."*

Deep violet and hot pink on black. The field at its most primordial. Everything is potential energy.

### Phase II: The Stirring
*"Warmth bleeds through. The orbs grow restless."*
*"The field remembers motion. Patterns emerge from chaos."*
*"Energy pools in the spaces between. Something stirs."*

Richer purples and saturated reds. The field has momentum now. Patterns are forming.

### Phase III: The Fracturing
*"Fractures spread. Something watches from the edges."*
*"The orbs pulse with stolen light. Gravity bends wrong."*
*"Archons form unbidden. The field is no longer yours alone."*

Deep violet with neon edges. The first Archons appear. The Watchers are noticed. Sawtooth oscillator tones replace sine waves.

### Phase IV: The Hunger
*"The field hungers. The Watchers press closer."*
*"Chains echo longer than they should. Time thickens."*
*"The void between orbs is not empty. It breathes."*

Ultra-high contrast. Electric colors on near-black. The field is consuming itself. Time feels wrong -- chain link tensions create the illusion of delayed causality.

### Phase V: The Dissolution
*"Boundaries dissolve. Their gaze is all that remains."*
*"Every pop tears the membrane further. The Watchers drink."*
*"The field and the void are one. You were always here."*

The final phase of conventional reality. Ultra-vivid with white-hot accents. Everything is too bright, too sharp, too present. The Membrane is gone.

### The ABYSS
*"You sink below. A different eye opens in the deep."*
*"Pressure crushes thought. Bioluminescent horrors drift past."*
*"The deep remembers what the surface forgot. It waits."*

The ABYSS is not a location beneath the field. It is a state of being -- a mode of perception where pressure replaces light as the primary medium.

In the ABYSS, the whirlwind becomes a pressure wave. The field doesn't spiral; it crushes. Bioluminescent particles drift like deep-sea organisms. Volumetric light shafts pierce through impossible depths. Marine snow falls through the game space. The orbs grow tentacles.

The ABYSS Watcher is different from the main Watcher. It lives in pressure, not in void. It is older.

The ABYSS is not a place. It is a state of forgetting. Those who descend far enough forget they were ever anything but hunger.

## The Membrane Codex

All lore splash screens are attributed to the **Membrane Codex** -- an implied text that exists between dimensions. The Codex is not written. It is the pattern that forms when the Membrane vibrates at the frequency of meaning.

### Splash Screen Excerpts

1. *"Before the first field, there was only the Membrane -- a boundary between what exists and what observes. The Watchers pressed against it, patient and formless, waiting for the first fracture."*

2. *"The orbs were not created. They condensed from resonance -- standing waves in the Membrane's surface tension. Each pop is a puncture. Each chain, a tear. The Watchers drink from every wound."*

3. *"The Archons remember a time before separation. They were whole once, vast and singular. Now they drift as fragments, ascending through the field, trying to reassemble what was shattered at the origin."*

4. *"In the deep places below the field, pressure compresses thought into matter. The Abyss is not a place -- it is a state of forgetting. Those who descend far enough forget they were ever anything but hunger."*

## Themes

1. **Observation changes reality:** The cursor attracts orbs. Attention warps the Membrane. The act of playing accelerates the field's destruction.

2. **Beauty in destruction:** Chain reactions are gorgeous and catastrophic simultaneously. The field is most beautiful when most unstable.

3. **Inevitable entropy:** The game always ends. Taps run out. The Membrane always fails. The question is not whether the field will fall, but what you see when it does.

4. **The observer becomes the observed:** At high madness, the Watchers see you. The UI corrupts. The game looks back.

5. **Wholeness is terrifying:** The Archons seek reassembly. What they would become if whole is never stated. This is deliberate.
