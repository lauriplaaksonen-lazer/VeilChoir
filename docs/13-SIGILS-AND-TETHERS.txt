POP FIELD — SIGILS & ARCHON TETHERS
=====================================

=== SIGILS (BOMB PLACEMENT) ===
Upgrade: "Sigil" (bombCharges), max level 3
Placement: Long press (350ms) at cursor position

Properties:
  Charges: 1-3 per tap cycle (= upgrade level)
  Fuse timer: 3.5 seconds (BOMB_FUSE_TIME)
  Blast radius: getBlastRadius() * 1.4 (140% multiplier)
  Auto-detonates after fuse OR when pulled into black hole event horizon
  Starts chain reaction if not already active
  Visual: "SIGIL SET" / "SIGIL PLACED" floating text on placement

Attractor field interaction:
  - Sigil detonations pull nearby orbs inward
  - Range: 60 + upgradeLevel * 30 px
  - Creates persistent gravity wells during fuse countdown
  - Pulls at 20% strength of black holes


=== ARCHON TETHERS (PHASE 5) ===

Orb-to-Orb Connections:
  - When orb ascends to Archon, forms 4-7 tethers to nearby orbs
  - Range: 260px + orbRadius * 2
  - Candidates: alive, not popped, not queued, not another Archon, not already tethered
  - Selection: closest orbs by distance
  - Tethered orbs pulse in sync with Archon (pulsePhase synced)
  - Tethered orbs are chain-immune (cannot be popped by blast propagation)
  - Dead/popped orbs pruned from tether list automatically

On Archon Death (Implosion):
  - Tethered orbs rush inward and auto-pop
  - Gravity well scales with remaining tether count:
    Gravity strength: 200 * (1 + count * 0.5)   [200 at 0, up to 900 at 7]
    Duration: 0.4s * (1 + count * 0.3)           [0.4s at 0, up to 1.24s at 7]
    Radius: blastR * (2.5 + count * 0.5)         [2.5x at 0, up to 6x at 7]
    Screen shake: 4 + count                       [4 at 0, up to 11 at 7]
  - Sound: Deep "ARCHON CRUNCH" + boom
  - Lore text: "THE ARCHON REMEMBERS" / "FRAGMENTS REUNITE" / "WHOLENESS DEVOURS"

On Archon Revert (Timer Expires):
  - All tethers release, orbs return to normal
  - Cooldown resets: 4.25-14.2 seconds before next mutation chance

Visual (Orb Tethers):
  - Pulsing energy lines from Archon center to each tethered orb
  - Main beam: biome-tinted, 1-2px width, pulsing alpha
  - Outer glow: wider stroke at low alpha
  - Glow ring on tethered orb: pulses in sync with Archon


=== ARCHON-SIGIL TETHERS (ENOCHIAN CONNECTIONS) ===

Formation:
  - On Archon ascension, scans for all placed Sigils within 350px
  - Forms extra tethers: scSigilTethers[] to each nearby bomb
  - Each stores: { bombIdx, pulsePhase, glyphSeed }
  - Stale tethers auto-pruned when bomb detonates or index invalid

Visual — Angular Rune-Like Beams:
  - 3 angular waypoints along path with perpendicular displacement
  - Creates sharp geometric bends (not smooth curves)
  - Bend amount: 12 + sin(glyphSeed * 3.7) * 8 pixels perpendicular offset

  Outer beam:
    Color: #c0a0ff (lavender-purple)
    Width: 1.0 + pulse * 0.8 px
    Alpha: 0.2 + pulse * 0.25

  Inner core line:
    Color: #e0c0ff (lighter lavender)
    Width: 0.4 + pulse * 0.4 px
    Alpha: 0.3 + pulse * 0.3

  Glyph marks at each waypoint:
    - Cross pattern (horizontal + vertical lines)
    - Diagonal rotating tick marks (angle = glyphSeed * index + time)
    - Center dot: #e0c0ff, radius 1.2 + pulse * 0.5
    - Color: #d0b0ff, 0.6px stroke

  Hexagonal glow ring around Sigil target:
    - 6-sided regular polygon
    - Color: #c0a0ff
    - Radius: 14 + pulse * 4 px
    - Alpha: 0.15 + pulse * 0.2


=== INTER-TETHER WEB ===
When Archon has 2+ tethered orbs:
  - Thin connecting lines form between all pairs of tethered orbs
  - Creates sigil-like geometric web pattern
  - Color: #c0a0ff
  - Alpha: 0.06 + combined pulse * 0.03
  - Width: 0.4 + combined pulse * 0.3 px
  - Purely visual — no gameplay effect


=== NEXUS BOSS TETHERS (SEPARATE SYSTEM) ===
The Nexus boss (B1) has its own independent tether mechanic:
  - Forms shield tethers to 3-4 nearby orbs
  - Range: 250px + bossRadius
  - Tethered orbs are chain-immune (must be direct-tapped to break)
  - Shield blocks all boss damage while tethers active
  - Breaking all tethers drops the shield for 0.5s
  - New tethers form after brief cooldown (1.5s initial, 0.5s after shield break)
  - Visual: pulsing energy beams from boss center to tethered orbs
  - NOT related to Archon tethers — completely separate system
