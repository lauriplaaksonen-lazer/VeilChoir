Tether & Sigil Connections:
  See 13-SIGILS-AND-TETHERS.txt for detailed Phase 5 tether mechanics,
  Archon-Sigil Enochian connections, inter-tether web, and implosion scaling.


=== BLACK HOLE (REGULAR) ===
Spawn: Every 25-45 seconds (random)
Lifetime: 8-16 seconds

Properties:
  Visual radius: 25px base (+3 per orb eaten)
  Gravity radius: 420px base (+15 per orb eaten)
  Strength: 1100 base (+80 per orb eaten)
  Tangent strength: 0.55 (creates orbital spin)
  Swallow zone: 50% of visual radius

Behavior:
  - Fades in over 1.2s
  - Pulls orbs with 1/d radial gravity
  - Tangential force creates orbiting
  - Swallows orbs that touch event horizon
  - Mass counter shown (N/5)
  - At 5+ mass: "TAP TO COLLAPSE" prompt
  - Auto-collapse after 3s of being ready
  - Or player taps to collapse manually (free — no tap cost)

Collapse:
  - Blast: 80% of BASE_BLAST_RADIUS + mass*12
  - Starts chain reaction (free — no tap cost)
  - Bonus taps: floor(mass/2) + 1
  - Horror boost: +0.01 + mass*0.003

Horror corruption:
  - Rate: 0.0015 + mass*0.001 per second while alive
  - Cap: 0.35

Visual (B1): Star Control style — dark core, spiraling dust, accretion ring
Visual (B2): Spinning ocean whirlpool — concentric rings, water distortion

Star dust: 25 particles spiraling inward
  - Each: angle, dist (0.3-0.9), size (0.5-2), speed (0.3-1.1)
  - Respawn at outer edge when reaching center

Black hole vortex: When active, creates localized swirl
  - Range: 80% of gravity radius
  - Strength: 30 + madness*80 (subtle at low, fierce at high)


=== SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE (SBH) ===
Spawn: madness > 75%, every 30-50 seconds
Lifetime: 8 seconds

Properties:
  Visual radius: 12% of shorter screen dimension (+5 per orb)
  Gravity radius: 55-70% of play area diagonal (+20 per orb)
  Strength: 3500 base (+150 per orb)
  Tangent ratio: 0.4
  Swallow zone: 12% of visual radius
  Collapse mass: 8 orbs

Behavior:
  - Fades in over 2.0s (dramatic)
  - Persistent screen rumble while active
  - Chromatic aberration while active (2 + mass*0.5)
  - Much stronger pull than regular BH (1/sqrt(d) falloff for wider range)
  - Swallows orbs at inner event horizon
  - At 8+ mass: "TAP TO COLLAPSE!" prompt
  - Auto-collapse after 4s ready or at death if mass >= 3

SUPERNOVA (SBH with mass >= SBH_COLLAPSE_MASS):
  - Triggers supernova instead of normal collapse
  - Blast covers 45%+ of play area (huge!)
  - Radius: 60% of play area diagonal * madness scale
  - Extended 2s chain reaction window
  - Bonus taps: ceil(mass * 0.75) + 2
  - Massive screen shake (15), chromatic ab (12), white glow
  - 12 extra gravity wells spawned around blast area
  - Boss damage: double hits

Normal collapse (mass < threshold):
  - Standard sized blast (55% base + mass*15)
  - Bonus taps: ceil(mass * 0.5) + 1

Horror corruption:
  - Rate: 0.003 + mass*0.0015 per second
  - Cap: 0.50

Visual (B1): Massive dark void with distortion, 60 spiraling dust particles
Visual (B2): Deep maelstrom — concentric water rings, massive scale


=== SHADOW BALLS ===
Spawn: madness >= 70%, every 0.15s
Max count: 40 (scales linearly from 70-100% madness)

Properties:
  Radius: 3-9px
  Non-interactive (can't be popped by player)
  Always somewhat translucent (alpha * 0.7)

Movement:
  - Same gravitational swirl as normal orbs but 1.5x amplified
  - More aggressive chaotic jitter (direction shifts every 0.3-1.3s)
  - Faster ambient wave (1.2x vs 0.6x)
  - Cursor gravity: 1.3x normal strength
  - Caught in whirlwinds and pressure waves (1.5x amplified)
  - Velocity damping: 0.92 (floaty)

Black Hole Feeding:
  - Shadow balls feed both regular and supermassive BH
  - Mass fraction = radius / BASE_CIRCLE_RADIUS (0.17-0.50)
  - 1.5x stronger pull than normal orbs
  - Dark particle burst on consumption

Visual:
  - Dark core: pure black radial gradient
  - Inner solid black circle (0.8x radius)
  - Subtle dark shimmer ring (0.25 alpha, oscillating)
  - B2 Abyss: faint bioluminescent corona at sat > 0.3
    - Color from vivid palette, very subtle (max alpha 0.105)


=== BOSS SYSTEM ===
(Section 10d — exists but details are in code around line 4357)
  - Boss spawns on timer (bossTimer, default 30s)
  - Has HP, state machine (appearing/active/dying)
  - Damaged by chain pops, BH collapses, SBH supernovae
  - Awards taps and score on kill
  - bossKillCount tracks total kills per run


=== WATCHER ENTITY ===
  - Appears at screen edges at high madness
  - watcher state: { opacity, eyeGlow, reachAmount, breathPhase }
  - Becomes more visible as madness increases
  - Eye glow and breath animation
  - "Tentacles" reaching inward from edges
  - Pure atmosphere — no gameplay interaction
